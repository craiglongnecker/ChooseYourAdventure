Choose Your Own Adventure, Parts 1 and 2, Weeks 9 and 10 Assignment in Java II

This program is in Java and Eclipse Photon.

Program created by Craig Longnecker

This is a relatively simple, two week website assignment that allows the user to enter
season ticket holders, either new or renewal, and then saves them to a database.
This information is then displayed when that page is selected.  I used Iowa State
football at Jack Trice Stadium as the basis for this program, as the drop down
menus are based on the sections and rows at that stadium.
